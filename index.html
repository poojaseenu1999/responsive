                             <p>SMARTLEARN provides students a wide variety of courses to build theri skills up.We provide major courses like CLOUD AWS , ARTIFICAIL INTELLIGENCE , MACHINE LEANING etc from zero to hero. We think our main moto is to make students have free courses and we provide them absolutly free of cost .</p> 
                             <p>Beginning with cognitive load theory as their motivating scientific premise, researchers such as Richard E. Mayer, John Sweller, and Roxana Moreno established within the scientific literature a set of multimedia instructional design principles that promote effective learning. Many of these principles have been "field tested" in everyday learning settings and found to be effective there as well. The majority of this body of research has been performed using university students given relatively short lessons on technical concepts with which they held low prior knowledge..</p>
                             <P>What is cloud computing?
                                Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).</P>

                            <p>SMARTLEARN provides students various courses . they are several rules which was construted for the purpose of students to gain knowledge in a correct path.students can take upto only 2 courses at a time . only after one of the course they are allowed to enroll fo the next course.this is because each and every course that SMARTLEEARN  provides will be vast and depth enough from zero to hero. this may take time and people cant jump to other in the half way . if they really dont want the course they have option to quit it in the middle and opt for other courses. </p> 
                            <p>In addition to experiential knowledge drawn from educational practice, educational technology is based on theoretical knowledge that emerges from various disciplines such as communication, education, psychology, sociology, artificial intelligence, and computer science, among others</p>
